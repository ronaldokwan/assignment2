# Task Management System

## Overview

This is a simple **Windows Forms (WinForms) Task Management System** in C#. It allows an **admin** to create users, manage tasks, and track task history. Users can view tasks assigned to them, mark them as done, and view the task history.

## Features

### Admin

* Can **create new users** (admin or regular users).
* Can **assign tasks** to users.
* Can **edit or delete any task**.
* Can **view all users and their tasks**.
* Can **sign out** and return to the login screen.

### User

* Can view tasks assigned to them.
* Can **mark tasks as done**.
* Can view **task history**.
* Cannot create or delete tasks.
* Cannot see other usersâ€™ tasks.

### General

* **Admin seeding:** If `database.txt` does not exist, a default admin is created:

  ```
  Username: admin
  Password: admin123
  Role: admin
  ```
* Task history is saved in `tasks.txt`.
* User database is saved in `database.txt`.
